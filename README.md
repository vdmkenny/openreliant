# OpenReliant

OpenReliant is an open-source, faithful engine reimplementation of **StarLancer**, the space combat simulator developed by Warthog and Digital Anvil and published by Microsoft in 2000.

Written in **Zig** and built on **SDL3**, OpenReliant renders with Vulkan (Metal on macOS) via SDL's GPU API. It runs natively on Linux, macOS, and Windows using assets directly from your retail copy of the game.

## Legal & Asset Policy

OpenReliant is an independent, non-commercial open-source project. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or associated with Warthog Games, Digital Anvil, or Microsoft. StarLancer is a trademark of its respective owner.

**This repository contains no copyrighted game assets**: no textures, 3D models, sound effects, music, cinematics, mission scripts, or game binaries. OpenReliant requires assets extracted from a legally owned copy of StarLancer to run. We do not support or condone software piracy.

## Current Status

OpenReliant is in active development. The first campaign mission is playable from start to finish.

- **Flight & Combat**: All ships, with the original flight model, weapons, damage, AI and cockpit displays, and 8 camera views including 3D cockpits.
- **Missions**: Retail and custom mission files load. The script of mission 1 runs in full, and the commands used by later missions are in progress.
- **Controls**: Mouse and keyboard, flight sticks, HOTAS and gamepads, with force feedback played as rumble, and the bindings set in the game's controls screen.
- **Graphics**: Per-pixel shading with gamma-corrected lighting, and real-time shadows. Rendering runs at native resolution in 32-bit colour, with bloom, anti-aliasing, smooth motion at high frame rates, and more detailed explosions, shields and planets. `--original` restores the original graphics and sound.
- **Audio**: 3D positional sound with reverb and headphone HRTF.
- **Mods**: Archives and folders in the game's `mods` folder can replace or add to any of the game's files: models, sounds, music, speech, movies and missions. PNG pictures of any size can replace textures, with material maps for physically based shading (normal maps, highlights and sky reflections), and the interface's shapes and backgrounds, including widescreen ones. Load scripts in Luau can change the ship, gun, missile and pilot stats and the game's text ([Modding](docs/guide/modding.md)).
- **Front End**: The main menu, the settings screen with its audio, controls, video and graphics, the pilot roster, the saved games and the Reliant's rooms, with a new pilot's induction, the news reports, the in-game options, the briefings, the loadout and the ITAC's debriefings.
- **In Development**: The rooms' simulator pod, locker and CD player, the remaining campaign missions, and multiplayer. See the [milestones](../../milestones) for the roadmap.

## Documentation

- [User guide](docs/guide/README.md): installing, configuring and playing OpenReliant.
- [Developer and technical documentation](docs/README.md): the engine, the file formats, the reverse engineering and the toolchain.

---

## Quickstart

Download the archive for your system from the [latest release](../../releases/latest) and extract it, then follow the [installation guide](docs/guide/installation.md): it installs the game's files from your StarLancer discs or disc images, and starts the game.

---

## Building from Source

Building OpenReliant needs [Zig 0.16](https://ziglang.org): see [Building from source](docs/guide/installation.md#building-from-source). [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) has the workflow for working on it.

---

## Reverse Engineering & Analysis Tools

The repository includes tools used during reverse engineering. `make help` lists the workflows, and [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md#getting-started) and the [toolchain](docs/toolchain.md) describe them.

The `sltool` utility, included with `openreliant` in each release, inspects, exports and packs the game's file formats. It exits with 0 on success, 2 for an unknown command (after printing its usage) and 1 on failure (with the error on stderr), so a mod's build scripts can use it:

| Command | Description | Documentation |
|---|---|---|
| `sltool cd` | Inspect CD images and ISO 9660 filesystems | [disc-images](docs/formats/disc-images.md) |
| `sltool hog` | Extract and pack `.HOG` archives (`BIGF` container / RefPack) | [hog](docs/formats/hog.md), [refpack](docs/formats/refpack.md) |
| `sltool shp` | Inspect `.SHP` 3D models; export Wavefront OBJ | [shp](docs/formats/shp.md) |
| `sltool spr` | Inspect `.SPR` 2D interface sprites; export PNG | [spr](docs/formats/spr.md) |
| `sltool tcache` | Extract texture caches to PNG | [tcache](docs/formats/tcache.md) |
| `sltool fat` | Extract `.fat` sound banks to WAV | [fat](docs/formats/fat.md) |
| `sltool fnt` | Render `.fnt` bitmap fonts into glyph atlases | [fnt](docs/formats/fnt.md) |
| `sltool dte` | Disassemble `.DTE` mission bytecode | [dte](docs/formats/dte.md) |
| `sltool stats` | Parse ship, weapon, and pilot stat tables | [stats](docs/formats/stats.md) |
| `sltool render` | Render 3D ship models with the software reference renderer | [renderer](docs/port/renderer.md) |
