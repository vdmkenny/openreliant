//! `openreliant missions`: lists the missions a game's folder holds, the loose files in its
//! `missions` folder and those in `resource.hog`, and binds each as a mission's start does, to show
//! that it loads. A mission of one's own, dropped into `missions`, is checked the same way. Each is
//! shown by what its file holds, as the file holds it: its counts, its format flags, the ship
//! type and name of the player's own record, and the name OpenReliant's own section gives it, where
//! the file has one (`dte.OpenReliantName`).
