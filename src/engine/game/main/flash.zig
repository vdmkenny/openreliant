//! The screen's flash, in `C:\lancer\game\main.cpp`: a capital ship coming apart close by lights
//! the whole view white for a moment (`0x00587CC8`), which `mission_frame` draws and counts down
//! (`screen_flash_draw`, `0x00494940`), and shows red while the player's display is shaken by a
//! hit (`hud.Interference`). **Unverified:** `0x00494940` lies after `main.cpp`'s known code,
//! before `matmanager.cpp`'s; by what it does it is this file's.
//!
//! A capital ship's engine exhaust whites the view out by its flash, and keeps the red away while
//! the player's ship stands in it (`environfx.Exhaust`).
