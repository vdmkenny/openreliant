//! The smoke a damaged ship trails, in `C:\lancer\game\main.cpp`: `mission_frame`'s pass over the

//! starts its smoke again from its model's first engine glow (`0x00494400`, `Stream.start`). A
//! badly damaged ship's smoke throws sparks and, now and then, a small fireball. **Unverified:**
//! the set-up and the plumes (`0x004946B0`) lie after `main.cpp`'s known code, before
//! `matmanager.cpp`'s; by what they do they are this file's.
