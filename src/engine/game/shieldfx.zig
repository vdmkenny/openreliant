//! `C:\lancer\game\shieldfx.cpp`: what a hit leaves where it struck (`0x004A0310`, 12 bytes), which
//! `0x004992D0` (`objects.cpp`) hangs from the part struck as a node of kind 6, by what struck:
//!
//! | Kind | Struck by | What it leaves |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | 2 | A shot or a missile through to a hull (`bullet_hull_hit`, `missile_hit_hull`) | The hit's sound (`hullHit`), and an emitter of `0x0049FD20`'s orange template on the part's surface nearest the point (`0x0049FEF0`), facing out from it |
//! | 3 | A shot or a missile on a component (`bullet_hit`, `0x0047B840`, `0x00495AC0`) | On an object with a shield generator that isn't exploding, its capital shield instead (`componentHit`); otherwise a burst of 20 of the orange template's particles |
//! | 4 | Nothing | An emitter of the grey template |
//! | 5 | A shot on a component of an asteroid, a turret asteroid or a hole (`bullet_hit`, `0x0047B840`) | Sound 71, and `0x00472780` |
//!
//! Nothing sends the emitters' particles out: `node_draw` updates a node of kind 6 through
//! `0x00458AB0`, which is the one routine the build keeps of every routine that only returns 1, so
//! a hull's emitter shows nothing.
//!
//! The port keeps no nodes, as none shows anything once made: it sounds a hull's hit, bursts a
//! component's, and sounds a rock's. The game hangs a part no more than a hundred nodes, so a hull's
//! part struck a hundred times no longer sounds; the port's sounds every time. A component's are
//! never that many: kind 3 first clears the nodes of earlier hits nearby, and the oldest past ten.
//!
//! Not ported: the rock chunk kind 5 throws (`0x00472780`,
//! [#41](https://github.com/vdmkenny/openreliant/issues/41)).
