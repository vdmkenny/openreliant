//! How loud a 3D sample is in each ear and how far its pitch moves, from where it is and how it
//! moves: the port's own provider, in place of the ones the game chooses from (`Miles Fast 2D
//! Positional Audio`, A3D, EAX and RSX), none of which it can load. It follows DirectSound3D's
//! model, which those follow too: the gain falls off as the minimum distance over the distance,
//! and no further past the maximum; the cone quietens a sample facing away; the Doppler shift uses
//! the velocities along the line between them.
//!
//! Positions are Miles's: the listener at the origin looking along `+z`, `+x` to its right and `+y`
//! up. Velocities are in the same units a millisecond.
