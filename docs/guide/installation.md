# Installation

OpenReliant needs the assets from a legally obtained copy of StarLancer (discs or disc images).

## Prerequisites

- StarLancer game media:
  - Retail CD-ROMs (disc 1 and disc 2), or
  - Disc image files (.bin with .cue, or .iso), or
  - Extracted disc folders.
- OpenReliant binary:
  - Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/vdmkenny/openreliant/releases/latest), or
  - Build from source using Zig 0.16.

## Quickstart

### 1. Extract OpenReliant

Download and extract the archive for your system (Linux, macOS, or Windows). Open a terminal in that folder:
- On Windows: right-click inside the folder and choose Open in Terminal.
- On macOS: right-click the folder in Finder and choose Services, then New Terminal at Folder.
- On Linux: right-click in your file manager and choose Open in Terminal.

On Windows, type `.\openreliant.exe` wherever these steps say `./openreliant`.

### 2. Allow the download to run (macOS only)

Release builds are not signed, so macOS blocks them until you run this once:

```bash
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine openreliant
```

### 3. Install game files

#### From physical discs

Insert StarLancer disc 1 into your drive and run:

```bash
./openreliant install StarLancer
```

The installer detects the CD drive, unpacks `LANCER.CAB` and copies required files (about 1.2 GB) into a folder named `StarLancer`. Any other folder name or path works too.

When prompted, insert disc 2 and press Enter to finish copying. If you do not have disc 2 at hand, type `skip` when asked for it. You can run the installer again later with disc 2 alone to add its files to an existing install.

#### From disc images (.bin or .iso)

If you have disc images or folders with the discs' files, name them with `--from`, once for each disc. Each disc is optional and the two can come in either order. For a `.bin` with a `.cue` next to it, name the `.bin`:

```bash
./openreliant install --from "StarLancer Disc 1.bin" --from "StarLancer Disc 2.bin" StarLancer
```

#### Other releases

If the installer says it does not recognize your disc (for example, from a regional release), add `--force` to install from it anyway:

```bash
./openreliant install --force StarLancer
```

Please also open an issue on GitHub stating which release you have and the size the installer gives for `LANCER.CAB`, so support can be added.

### 4. Launch the game

Run the executable with the installed folder:

```bash
./openreliant StarLancer
```

The game starts in the pause menu:
- Choose CONTINUE (or press Escape) to start flying.
- Escape reopens the pause menu at any time. In the pause menu, LEAVE MISSION quits, and RESTART restarts the sandbox.
- Press F2 or F3 to cycle through available player ships.
- Press F4 to bring in another enemy wing.
- Keys 1 to 8 switch camera views: 1 cockpit, 2 left, 3 right, 4 rear, 5 flyby, 6 target, 7 external, and 8 missile.

## Building from source

To compile OpenReliant, install [Zig 0.16](https://ziglang.org). Dependencies (SDL3, OpenAL Soft, libarchive) build from source automatically:

```bash
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseFast
zig-out/bin/openreliant install StarLancer
zig-out/bin/openreliant StarLancer
```

## Next steps

- [Controllers and input](controllers.md): Set up gamepads, flight sticks, HOTAS devices, and button mappings.
- [Configuration and options](configuration.md): Command-line options for graphics, sound, and display settings.
